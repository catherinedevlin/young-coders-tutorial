Young Coders: Outside In
========================

TA instructions
---------------

- The primary goal is a positive experience for each student.  That's more important than learning any specific thing about Python.

- Your enthusiasm is part of bringing that positive experience!  Let it shine through.  

- Each TA should take primary charge of a small group of students, hopefully about 4.

- We'll spend a lot of time asking students to try out code on their own.

    - If any students aren't moving, see if they need a hint or a nudge to get started 

    - Give the teachers a thumbs-up when your group is ready to move on

    - If some students finish quickly and seem bored, suggest variants they can try  

- Try to strike a balance between underhelping and overhelping.  They should feel like

    - Help is here for them when they need it

    - But they are the heroes of their own story

- Don't ever type anything for a student!  You can write out examples on paper for them, though.  Either

    - Examples that illustrate the idea, but need to be altered for their specific problem

    - Scaffolding: examples with gaps they need to fill in themselves.

- Favor clarity over technical correctness.  Use approximations that are easy to understand, even if later they'll learn that they were incomplete.  Resist the urge to go down rabbit trails of interesting exceptions, underlying complexities, etc.  

- Avoid:

    - Unexplained jargon.  Encourage them to catch you on this!

    - "Well, actually..." - when their understanding is good enough for now, don't showboat! 

    - "Oh, you didn't know that?" - makes people feel cut down.  We're going to have a wide variety of levels of preparedness, and we don't want anyone to feel bad about that. 

- Help the teachers understand if our pace is wrong or if we need to explain better.  Help other TAs out if they're forgetting some of these guidelines.
